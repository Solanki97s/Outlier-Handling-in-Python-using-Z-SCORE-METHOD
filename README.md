Outlier Handling in Python using Z-Score Method

ðŸ“Œ Introduction

Outliers can significantly impact machine learning models and statistical analyses. The Z-Score method is a widely used technique to detect and remove outliers based on standard deviations from the mean.

ðŸ“Š What is Z-Score Method?

The Z-score (also known as the standard score) measures how many standard deviations a data point is from the mean. It is calculated as:



where:

X = Data point

\mu = Mean of the dataset

\sigma = Standard deviation
